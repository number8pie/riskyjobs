#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Added a preg_match statement (line 44) to check the format the phone number has been entered.
This uses an if else statement to echo an error and show the form if it's not valid, if it is valid it uses preg_replace to replace parenthesis or spaces with an empty string, (so the number canbe passed to the MySQLquery as a string of just numbers) and then echoes out the number without spaces or parenthesis to the page, just to check it's doing it right.
On line 52 below it is the statement without the preg_replace and echo to check it's right, I assume the preg_replace would be done just before the query is constructed.
